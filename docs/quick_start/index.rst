Horizontal Reflectors (Single Source)
=====================================

.. note::

    The problem in this example is small enough that it can be run in serial
    on a normal laptop in (at worst) a few minutes.  For a more complex
    example that should run in parallel, see
    :ref:`quick_start_example_marmousi`.

Marmousi2 Velocity (Many Sources)
=================================

.. warning::

    The problem in this example is designed to be run in parallel.  It can be
    run in serial, but it will be very expensive.  It is strongly recommended
    that you go through the simpler example above, first.
